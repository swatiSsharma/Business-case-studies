Hints

The exploration should have a goal. As you explore the data, keep in mind that you want to answer which type of shows to produce and how to grow the business. Ensure each recommendation is backed by data. The company is looking for data-driven insights, not personal opinions or anecdotes. Assume that you are presenting your findings to business executives who have only a basic understanding of data science. Avoid unnecessary technical jargon. Start by exploring a few questions: What type of content is available in different countries? How has the number of movies released per year changed over the last 20-30 years? Comparison of tv shows vs. movies. What is the best time to launch a TV show? Analysis of actors/directors of different types of shows/movies. Does Netflix has more focus on TV Shows than movies in recent years Understanding what content is available in different countries

Inference: India's choice for movies has always been "TV-14" (unsuitable for children under 14 years of age) rated since around the 1980s. This choice does not come as a surprise since India being a Familialistic nation would naturally want to watch movies as a Family which includes everyone from children to grandparents without any explicit content. However, it is surprising to see a slight change in the Movie/TV show trends since the pandemic started. Of course, there has been a significant overall reduction in the number of movies rolled out since the pandemic, but the decline in "TV-14" rated shows is more strong compared to the "TV-MA" rated shows. This has supposedly got to be associated with the behavioral change that has been inflicted upon us since lockdowns started. People have probably started to watch movies individually rather not as a Family or group which has led to a lesser decline in movies meant for mature adults.

Recommendation: Netflix should add more movies that are "TV-MA" and "TV-14" rated.
